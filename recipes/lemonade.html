        <li>

            Meanwhile, roll lemons around on your counter to soften. Cut in half crosswise, and squeeze into a liquid measuring cup. Add pulp to the juice, but discard any seeds. Continue juicing until you have 1 1/2 cups fresh juice and pulp.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour 7 cups ice-cold water into a pitcher. Stir in lemon juice and pulp, then add simple syrup to taste. Add ice.

    </ol>
    <h2>Cook's Note:</h2>
    <p>
        To make ahead, refrigerate the cooled simple syrup for up to one month. Continue with Step 3 when ready to serve.

        Nine medium lemons should yield about 1 1/2 cups juice and pulp, but the number required will depend on the size you use.
