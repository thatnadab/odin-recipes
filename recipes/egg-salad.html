    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The tang from Dijon mustard, freshness from lemon, and liveliness from watercress make Jen's heavenly egg salad a must! This recipe tastes best when paired with wheat bread, watercress, and avocado, but I can eat it alone.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped green onions</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped green onions</li>
        <li>½ lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon prepared yellow mustard</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, cover, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine mayonnaise, green onions, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, and yellow mustard in a large bowl until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Chop eggs into big chunks; add to the bowl with dressing. Gently stir until evenly combined; season with salt and black pepper.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Cook's Note:</h2>
    <p>
        For faster cooling, place eggs in an ice water bath before peeling.
